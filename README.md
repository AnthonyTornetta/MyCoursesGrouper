# MyCourses Grouper

Organizes the contents of a mass download from MyCourses.

## How does it work?

- Give it the directory the extracted mycourses download info is in
- Give it the directory to export the parsed files
- Tell it whether or not to extract the found zip files (only in the top-level directory)
- Done!

It organizes the files by the students' names
